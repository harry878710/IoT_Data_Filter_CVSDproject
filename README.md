# IoT_Data_Filter_CVSDproject

Brief introduction:
  1. Processed 128-bit unsigned data from the sensors by dividing in 16 8-bit data and output result in real-time written in Verilog.
  2. Low power design using clock gating, lower switching activity, hardware sharing to decrease the performance: PT (Wt)
  3. Functions: Max, Min, Avg, Extract, Exclude, PeakMax, PeakMin
  4. Done RTL and gate-level simulation

The regulation is described in 1091_hw6.pdf
